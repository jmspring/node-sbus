node-sbus
=========

A library for connecting to Azure Service Bus services.

Currently, only Event Hub is supported and can be accessed by one of two methods:

1. By individual partition
2. By the entire eventhub (referred to as Event Processor)

The examples in the "test" directory give a general approach on how to use each method.
